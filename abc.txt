A day after interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi reprimanded the G 23 leaders for using the media to voice their opinions, Punjab unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday used the same platform to list out issues facing the party in the state. 
He wrote a letter to Sonia Gandhi and shared a copy of the same on Twitter. 
Further, with an eye on the upcoming assembly polls next year, Sidhu also asked for a personal meeting to present his 13-point agenda which is to be part of the poll manifesto.
I further request you to kindly give me a personal audience to present to you the Punjab Model with a 13-Point Agenda to be part of the Congress Manifesto for the 2022 Assembly Elections, which is separate from this by means of its long-term vision to be implemented over a longer period of time, have crafted it through years of consultations with academics, civil society, party workers and feedback from the People of Punjab, Sidhu said.
